## Summary
- analyze data sets that correlate to mental health conditions
  - Socio economic status
  - culture
  - environment
  - individual behaviours (depression anxiety)
- use stats tech to develop trends and correlations
- predictive model to forecast mental health outcomes based on key variables
- or stats correlation model (pearson/spearman techniques)

## What i need to to
- explore data sets
- analyze the data
  - descriptive stats,
  - correlation
  - t-tests
  - chi squared
- Build models
  - logistic regression
  - decision trees
  - random forests
- reduce complexity
- visualize trends
  - box plots
  - violin plots
  - heat maps
- highlight bio markers
